            <h3>Mother Nature's Rights</h3>
            <h5>by Shine Schokman</h5><br>
            <p>
                Mother nature's rights<br>
                Are also my rights!<br>
                It is my fight!<br>
                Let's gather our might to win this fight!
            </p>
            <p>Is this the truth or is this our expectation?</p>
            <p>
                Nature stands for nature's side,<br>
                Man stands for man's side,<br>
                Maybe you can say that this is world war 3!<br>
                Do you see?
            </p>
            <p>
                No? Well look,<br>
                What's all around you? Plastic, wood?<br>
                I guess the answer would be yes!<br>
                Isn't this a mess?
            </p>
            <p>
                Man strikes<br>
                Nature strikes,<br>
                This is a never ending war!<br>
                Saving mother nature should be a law!
            </p>
            <p>
                We shouldn't brawl!<br>
                Or stand tall! <br>
                Instead we should stand together,<br>
                Forever and ever!
            </p>
            <p>
                Reuse<br>
                Reduce<br>
                Recycle<br>
                Should be our motto!
            </p>
            <p>
                So let's gather together!<br>
                Protect mother nature forever!<br>
                One step at a time,<br>
                Could be just enough to stop this crime!

            <h3>Help Save the Trees</h3>
            <h5>intoducing a radical idea by Ihansa Sahabandu</h5><br>
            <p>A tree is a tall perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. Trees are very important for the 
                existence of human beings. Providing oxygen, reducing the amount of storm water runoff and protection are a few examples.</p>
            <p>Though trees provide us with many requirements we human beings destroy them. Trees are cut and burned down for a number of reasons. Forests are 
                logged to supply timber for wood and paper products, and to clear land for crops, cattle, and housing. It can also be eforested by mining and oil exploitation.</p>
            <p>Yes, it is true that we also have to cut trees for our needs. One thing we can do to minimize it is, planting trees and recycling.</p>
            <p>There is one more thing we can do to minimize cutting trees. We know that more than a thousand people die in one day and can you just imagine how 
                many trees are being cut to make coffins in one day? It may be more than 100 trees. Why can’t we make coffins out of recycable cardboard? One 
                thing is, they can easily be burned. We all know that a dead body won't feel anything. We cut many trees for something which is useless. Isn’t my 
                idea useful to minimize cutting trees?</p>
            <p>As I said we have many ways to minimize cutting trees. Come on, let’s all get together and save trees and save the earth.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>See the World</h3>
            <h5>by Tanushri Jayasuriya</h5><br>
            <p>See the world through the eyes of a bird.<br>
               And know how it feels to be free<br>
               See the world through the eyes of a lion,<br>
               Who'd spend the rest of his days in captivity
            </p>
            <p>See the world through the eyes of  mountain,<br>
               Who'd watch over the lands below<br>
               Standing tall over acres of wilderness<br>
               With its peaks covered in snow
            </p>
            <p>See the world through the eyes of the ancient tree,<br>
               Who had sprouted a century ago<br>
               Who was once a life-giving mother<br>
               But is now just a dull wooden floor
            </p>
            <p>See the world through the eyes of the people<br>
               Who were shunned by the colour of their skin<br>
               And their faith and their race and their culture,<br>
               Who were treated like mere possession or thing
            </p>
            <p>See the world from a different point of view<br>
               To learn things you never would know<br>
               Every living being is important<br>
               And they all deserve to grow.
