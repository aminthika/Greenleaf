            <p>A big problem about being concerned about our environment in the time of this pandemic is that we can't go outside to plant anything, to protest,
                or to host campaigns. There is only one way left for many people to contribute to nature, and that way is by signing online petitions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Cambridge English dictionary defines a petition as 'a document signed by a large number of people demanding or asking for some action from 
                the government or another authority'. Right now in a world being repeatedly attacked by the coronavirus a petition is a way to help make things 
                better without placing your life and other's lives at risk.

            <p>1) <a href="http://chng.it/xNt7Zz9XLd"><strong>The Global Petition to Save the Amazon</strong></a></p>
            <p>One major environmental catastrophe is that the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, one of the biggest rainforests in the world and home to thousands of 
                plants and animals, is getting destroyed due to deforestation and climate change. There are petitions to try and stop this from happening and if 
                you spare a few minutes to check them out you can find a lot of things you can do to help nature while staying at home. One such petition is
                the Global Petition to Save the Amazon hosted at change.org.
            </p>
            <p>2) <a href="http://chng.it/2Mq97pPbqc"><strong>Encourage Amazon to minimize plastic pollution in their packaging</strong></a></p>
            <p>
                Speaking of Amazon let's move on to the largest Internet company based on revenue in the world. A non-profit environmental group discovered that 
                in 2019 alone Amazon used an estimated amount of 465 million pounds of plastic packaging. They also estimated that 22 million pounds of Amazon's 
                plastic packaging ended up in freshwater and marine ecosystems and caused serious damage to them. Amazon has already started using recycled paper 
                shioned packaging but they don't use it as frequently as plastic. This petition by Green Point Juicey is trying to get Amazon to change
                that, and they could use all the help we can give.

            <p>3) <a href="http://chng.it/BZS2w8rTnp"><strong>Save The Congo Rainforest</strong></a></p>
            <p>
                As we go back to rainforests who can ignore the the Congo Rainforest? The Congo, located in Africa, is the second largest river in the world in 
                volume. It drains an area of 3.7 million square kilometers that is known as the Congo Basin. More than 600  species of trees and over 10,000 
                different species of animals can be found in this rainforest. Even though it is one of the worlds few remaining rainforests it faces many threats, 
                the biggest of these being deforestation. The biggest drivers of deforestation are industrial plantation, especially for sugar and oil. 
                Fortunately a lot of people are concerned about this great rainforest being destroyed in this way. If you are interested in assisting them, sign
                this petition on change.org now.

            <p>4) <a href="http://chng.it/fyhsftBg85"><strong>Free the Disney Dolphins</strong></a></p>
            <p>If you have ever traveled to Disneyland you might have noticed that they have some captive dolphins at one of the 'exhibits'. In the wild dolphins 
                can travel from 40 to 80 miles every day. In captivity they are confined to a glass tank where they do not have the freedom to move around at 
                all. They experience a great deal of stress and they are surrounded by screaming children and amplified voices which do not help in any way. By 
                signing this petition by Blue Freedom, you will contribute to the freedom of these beautiful creatures who deserve to be free.

            <p>5) <a href="http://chng.it/B9Rf7mF9Cq"><strong>#UpTheCup: Starbucks Use A Recyclable Paper Cup!</strong></a></p>
            <p>Next we head over to a very popular coffee shop, Starbucks. Starbucks uses up over 8,000 plastic cups a minute which adds up to nearly 4 billion 
                a year. To keep up with this, more than 1.6 million trees have to be cut down to make all these cups. And they can't be recycled either since the 
                inside has been covered with polythene. Sign this petition by the SEAL Impact team on change.org to make Starbucks switch to recyclable cups.
            </p>
            <p>6) <a href="http://chng.it/B9Rf7mF9Cq"><strong>Protect polar bears. No oil drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge</strong></a></p>
            <p>Our next stop is the Arctic. All the animals and people who live in this cold place depend on the Arctic's very unique ecosystem to survive. But 
                major companies are making moves to start oil drilling in the Arctic. Russia has already begun. Right now a certain company is planning to drill 
                for oil in the last preserved piece of nature in the USA. This will probably end up with several major problems regarding the polar bears and 
                every living thing is the Arctic. There is more than a 75% chance that there will be a huge oil spill in the Arctic if we continue with these 
                plans for oil drilling. This is more likely to happen in the Arctic because of the fragile ice layers and the incredibly tricky weather conditions. 
                Thousands of animals and people will die or lose their homes. If you sign this petition we might be able to stop this from happening.

                            <p class="card-text">We receive hundreds of gifts from Nature that are vital to our survival, and that's one of the many reasons why we
                                should conserve the resources we have, instead of destroying them. In this article, Theruni Abeysinghe discusses the value of the trees
                                in our surroundings, and why we shouldn't be tearing them down.</p>

                                difference. But every drop of water is precious and all the carbon dioxide released by your actions add up, and in the end we’re 
                                all to blame. The flash floods may not be happening outside your door, the droughts may not have reached you, but they’re 
                                happening. And they will keep happening and becoming worse.</p>
